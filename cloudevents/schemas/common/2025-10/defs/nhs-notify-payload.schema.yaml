    $comment: Union of two variant payload shapes. anyOf is used (instead of oneOf) because the two variants are currently placeholders and not mutually differentiable. Once DataPlane and ControlPlane gain distinct required properties or a discriminator, switch to oneOf (and optionally add a 'plane' enum property) to prevent ambiguous matches.
